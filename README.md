# my-first-code-challenge

challenge 1( grading system)
The programme works as a student grade generator whereby upon an input marks, it returns the correct grade. Say for example a student has 66 marks, we will have to declare the grade and call out the function. 
for example, const grade=66, the result is a "B" grade.





challenge 2( speed detector)
The programme returns "OK" if the speed is less than 70. However, upon an increase of speed, the number of points increases by each 5km/hr.
if the speed exceeds 130, which is equivalent to 12 points, the programme returns a message, "License suspended."



challenge 3(salary calculator)
Both personal relief and NSSF are a constant, that is, ksh 2400 and ksh 400.
However, so as to get the netsalary, we deduct all deductions( PAYE,relief,NHIF and NSSF).
So as to get the PAYE , we calculate the respective rate multiplied by the taxable income, in my case, 24000.
